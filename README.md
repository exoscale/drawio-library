# The Exoscale Icon Libraries

The Exoscale `draw.io` icon libraries provide three sets of icons to visualize and conceptualize various architecture and infrastructure diagrams. These libraries are for the tool [diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/), previously draw.io, an online diagramming website.


## Exoscale Symbol
The file `exo-sym_v3.xml` holds the library of the Exoscale Symbol icons for product and feature.

## Usage
If you have opened all three icon libraries, you can access all icons on the right-hand side of the UI; clicking on one of the icons will place it on your drawing canvas. The initial icon sizing is so structured that usage is proportionally aligned.
